# Bowling TDD kata

This is a TDD (Test Driven Development) kata from 12meses12katas.

You must calculate the score of a bowling game, using the bowling rules.

## Using Git to save TDD history

I'm using Git to save my TDD history, here are some techniques that I'm using:

  * My development is in a branch named 'develop'.
  * In master there are only 'final' versions of my development.
  * Create tags for every test that I created and developed.

So everybody can follow my workflow, here is a short explanation:

  1. Add a new test, I'm pretty sure that my code won't pass this test.
  2. Commit my changes.
  3. Refactor my code to pass this new test.
  4. Also, my new code must pass all previous tests.
  5. Commit my changes, and back to #1.
